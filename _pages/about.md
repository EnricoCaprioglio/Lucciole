With my supervisor [Luc Berthouze](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p201607-luc-berthouze) I work on complex systems, at the intersection between network science and neuroscience, or I may say network neuroscience.

The [projects section](https://enricocaprioglio.github.io/Lucciole/projects/) on this website is supposed to be the scientific part of the website, with my contributions and scientific questions that I am working on. The [blog section](https://enricocaprioglio.github.io/Lucciole/blog/) instead, is the "informal" part of the website. I will write about my personal motivations to study the things I spend a lot of time on, and the "unscientific" intuitions that I think everyone needs to have to do science. If this sounds wrong to you or intrigued you, check my first blog post!
