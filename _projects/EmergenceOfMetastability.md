Check the dedicated GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/EnricoCaprioglio/Emergence-of-metastability-in-frustrated-oscillatory-networks) for all the code. If you are a Julia user, you can simply download the `.jl` file. Otherwise, download the .`html` file.

The latter can be viewed on any browser, and you can also run it via `Binder`. To do this, just follow the instructions in the introduction section. The notebook has many different buttons that will allow you to explore the system, so no need to know how to code to play around with the model! If you do want to check the function, all the functions can be found at the end of the script.
